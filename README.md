**IMPORTANT: due to changes in the pricing model for the Weather Underground API, development of the WUnderground plugin will cease with the latest release.**

**I will continue to provide bug fixes, but there will be no further feature development.**

The Wunderground 7 plugin allows users to create weather devices for Indigo that 
are linked to Weather Underground by providing a bridge between the Weather 
Underground API service and Indigo.

obtain weather data from the service. It also requires Internet
