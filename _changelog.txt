WUnderground 7 Plugin - Developed by: DaveL17

Note: WUnderground 7 requires Indigo 7

7.0.10
- Fixes bug in setting timedelta for plugin refresh cycle.

7.0.09
- Rounds off values for weather device forecast values. Some PWSs will
  report decimal-level precision even though it's unlikely that they mean to.
- Changes to the poll frequency and Temperature Item List plugin preferences
  now take effect when preferences are saved (all other display preferences
  continue to take effect during the next scheduled poll.)
- Standardizes all timeouts at 20 seconds (from 10 seconds) and reduces the
  urllib backup timeout to 20 seconds (from 30 seconds). Timeouts now 20
  seconds across all calls.
- Adds validation for weather location offline trigger settings.
- Limits weather location offline triggers to one per location.
- Improves indication of offline weather sites (improves upon v7.0.08).
- Improves handling of Indigo UI images for on/offline.
- Fixes bug where changes to weather location offline trigger were made while
  the trigger was disabled.
- Fixes typo in metric forecast email ('mm' instead of 'nm').
- Code enhancements.

7.0.08
- Adds new plugin configuration option for pressure trend display.
- Improves indication of offline weather sites.

7.0.07
- Improves code commenting and adds Sphinx compatibility to docstrings.
- Improves UI experience when weather locations go offline.
- Improves UI experience when user changes device settings (while waiting for
  the next API call).
- Adds API 2.0 device state updates to weather devices (fewer resources used,
  speed increased).
- Fixes bug in setting WindShortString state for weather devices.
- Fixed bug in Ten Day Forecast devices for setting for rain and snow default
  units.
- Adds version check to ensure that user is running Indigo 7 or greater.

  setting to receive weather email summary.
- Takes advantage of Indigo API improvements for device state updates (uses
  many fewer system resources).

- Limits list of devices for severe weather alert trigger to only weather
  devices (only weather devices have alert information available.)
