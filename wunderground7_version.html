EmailBody: The Wunderground 7 Plugin you are using has been updated.

A WUnderground 7 Plugin update is now available.

v7.0.09

- Rounds off values for weather device forecast values. Some PWSs will
  report decimal-level precision even though it's unlikely that they mean to.
- Changes to the poll frequency and Temperature Item List plugin preferences
  now take effect when preferences are saved (all other display preferences
  continue to take effect during the next scheduled poll.)
- Standardizes all timeouts at 20 seconds (from 10 seconds) and reduces the
  urllib backup timeout to 20 seconds (from 30 seconds). Timeouts now 20
  seconds across all calls.
- Adds validation for weather location offline trigger settings.
- Limits weather location offline triggers to one per location.
- Improves indication of offline weather sites (improves upon v7.0.08).
- Improves handling of Indigo UI images for on/offline.
- Fixes bug where changes to weather location offline trigger were made while
  the trigger was disabled.
- Fixes typo in metric forecast email ('mm' instead of 'nm').
- Code enhancements.

As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
